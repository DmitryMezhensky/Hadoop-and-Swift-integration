Swift
-----

A distributed object store that was originally developed as the basis for 
Rackspace's Cloud Files.

To build documentation run `python setup.py build_sphinx`, and then browse to
/doc/build/html/index.html.

The best place to get started is the "SAIO - Swift All In One", which will walk
you through setting up a development cluster of Swift in a VM.

For more information, visit us at http://launchpad.net/swift, or come hang out
on our IRC channel, #openstack on freenode.
