This is the configuration file used by the object server and other object 
background services, such as; replicator, updater and auditor. 

The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided
into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a 
certain number of key/value parameters which are described later. 

Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.
