.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-account-reaper 
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Removes data from status=DELETED accounts. These are accounts that have
been asked to be removed by the reseller via services remove_storage_account
XMLRPC call.

the account is simply marked for deletion by setting the status column in
the account_stat table of the account database. This account reaper scans
for such accounts and removes the data in the background. The background
deletion process will occur on the primary account server for the account.
