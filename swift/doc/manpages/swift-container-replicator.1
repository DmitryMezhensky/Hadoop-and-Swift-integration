[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Replication is designed to keep the system in a consistent state in the face of 
temporary error conditions like network outages or drive failures. The replication 
processes compare local data with each remote copy to ensure they all contain the 
latest version. Container replication uses a combination of hashes and shared high 
water marks to quickly compare subsections of each partition.
.PP
Replication updates are push based. Container replication push missing records over 
HTTP or rsync whole database files. The replicator also ensures that data is removed
from the system. When an container item is deleted a tombstone is set as the latest 
version of the item. The replicator will see the tombstone and ensure that the item 
is removed from the entire system.
