.SH NAME

.B swift-container-server
\- Openstack-swift container server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-container-server
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
The Container Server's primary job is to handle listings of objects. It doesn't know 
where those objects are, just what objects are in a specific container. The listings 
are stored as sqlite database files, and replicated across the cluster similar to how 
objects are. Statistics are also tracked that include the total number of objects, and 
total storage usage for that container.
