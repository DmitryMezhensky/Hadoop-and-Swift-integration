.SH NAME 
.LP
.B swift-container-sync
\- Openstack-swift container sync

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-container-sync
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Swift has a feature where all the contents of a container can be mirrored to
another container through background synchronization. Swift cluster operators
configure their cluster to allow/accept sync requests to/from other clusters,
and the user specifies where to sync their container to along with a secret 
synchronization key.
.PP
The swift-container-sync does the job of sending updates to the remote container.
This is done by scanning the local devices for container databases and checking
for x-container-sync-to and x-container-sync-key metadata values. If they exist,
newer rows since the last sync will trigger PUTs or DELETEs to the other container.
