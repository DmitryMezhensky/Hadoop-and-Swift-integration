.SH NAME 
.LP
.B swift-container-updater
\- Openstack-swift container updater

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-container-updater 
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
The container updater is responsible for updating container information in the account database. 
It will walk the container path in the system looking for container DBs and sending updates
to the account server as needed as it goes along. 

There are times when account data can not be immediately updated. This usually occurs 
during failure scenarios or periods of high load. This is where an eventual consistency 
window will most likely come in to play. 

In practice, the consistency window is only as large as the frequency at which 
the updater runs and may not even be noticed as the proxy server will route 
listing requests to the first account server which responds. The server under
load may not be the one that serves subsequent listing requests â€“ one of the other
two replicas may handle the listing.

The options are as follows:
