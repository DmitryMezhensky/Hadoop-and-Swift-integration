.SH NAME 
.LP
.B swift-object-expirer
\- Openstack-swift object expirer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-object-expirer 
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
The swift-object-expirer offers scheduled deletion of objects. The Swift client would 
use the X-Delete-At or X-Delete-After headers during an object PUT or POST and the 
cluster would automatically quit serving that object at the specified time and would 
shortly thereafter remove the object from the system.

The X-Delete-At header takes a Unix Epoch timestamp, in integer form; for example: 
1317070737 represents Mon Sep 26 20:58:57 2011 UTC.

The X-Delete-After header takes a integer number of seconds. The proxy server 
that receives the request will convert this header into an X-Delete-At header 
using its current time plus the value given.

The options are as follows:

.RS 4
.PD 0
.IP "-v"
.IP "--verbose"

.IP "log to console"

.IP "-o"
.IP "--once"
