.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-object-replicator 
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Replication is designed to keep the system in a consistent state in the face of 
temporary error conditions like network outages or drive failures. The replication 
processes compare local data with each remote copy to ensure they all contain the 
latest version. Object replication uses a hash list to quickly compare subsections 
of each partition.
.PP
Replication updates are push based. For object replication, updating is just a matter 
of rsyncing files to the peer. The replicator also ensures that data is removed
from the system. When an object item is deleted a tombstone is set as the latest 
version of the item. The replicator will see the tombstone and ensure that the item 
is removed from the entire system.
