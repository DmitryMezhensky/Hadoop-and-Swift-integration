\- Openstack-swift object server.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-object-server
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
The Object Server is a very simple blob storage server that can store, retrieve
and delete objects stored on local devices. Objects are stored as binary files 
on the filesystem with metadata stored in the file's extended attributes (xattrs).
This requires that the underlying filesystem choice for object servers support 
xattrs on files. Some filesystems, like ext3, have xattrs turned off by default. 
Each object is stored using a path derived from the object name's hash and the operation's
timestamp. Last write always wins, and ensures that the latest object version will be
served. A deletion is also treated as a version of the file (a 0 byte file ending with
".ts", which stands for tombstone). This ensures that deleted files are replicated 
correctly and older versions don't magically reappear due to failure scenarios.
