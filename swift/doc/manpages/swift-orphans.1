.SH NAME 
.LP
.B swift-orphans
\- Openstack-swift orphans tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-orphans 
[-h|--help] [-a|--age] [-k|--kill] [-w|--wide]


.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Lists and optionally kills orphaned Swift processes. This is done by scanning
/var/run/swift for .pid files and listing any processes that look like Swift
processes but aren't associated with the pids in those .pid files. Any Swift
processes running with the 'once' parameter are ignored, as those are usually
for full-speed audit scans and such.

Example (sends SIGTERM to all orphaned Swift processes older than two hours): 
swift-orphans -a 2 -k TERM

The options are as follows:

.RS 4
.PD 0
.IP "-a HOURS"
.IP "--age=HOURS"
.RS 4
.IP "Look for processes at least HOURS old; default: 24"
.RE
.IP "-k SIGNAL"
.IP "--kill=SIGNAL"
.RS 4
.IP "Send SIGNAL to matched processes; default: just list process information"
.RE
.IP "-w"
.IP "--wide"
.RS 4
.IP "Don't clip the listing at 80 characters"
.RE
.PD
.RE
