Hardware Considerations
-----------------------

Swift is designed to run on commodity hardware. At Rackspace, our storage
servers are currently running fairly generic 4U servers with 24 2T SATA
drives and 8 cores of processing power. RAID on the storage drives is not
required and not recommended. Swift's disk usage pattern is the worst
case possible for RAID, and performance degrades very quickly using RAID 5
or 6.

------------------
Deployment Options
------------------

The swift services run completely autonomously, which provides for a lot of
flexibility when architecting the hardware deployment for swift. The 4 main
services are:

#. Proxy Services
#. Object Services
#. Container Services
#. Account Services

The Proxy Services are more CPU and network I/O intensive. If you are using
10g networking to the proxy, or are terminating SSL traffic at the proxy,
greater CPU power will be required.

The Object, Container, and Account Services (Storage Services) are more disk
and network I/O intensive.

The easiest deployment is to install all services on each server. There is
nothing wrong with doing this, as it scales each service out horizontally.

At Rackspace, we put the Proxy Services on their own servers and all of the
Storage Services on the same server. This allows us to send 10g networking to
the proxy and 1g to the storage servers, and keep load balancing to the
proxies more manageable.  Storage Services scale out horizontally as storage
servers are added, and we can scale overall API throughput by adding more
Proxies.

If you need more throughput to either Account or Container Services, they may
each be deployed to their own servers. For example you might use faster (but
more expensive) SAS or even SSD drives to get faster disk I/O to the databases.

Load balancing and network design is left as an exercise to the reader,
but this is a very important part of the cluster, so time should be spent
designing the network for a Swift cluster.

.. _ring-preparing:

------------------
Preparing the Ring
------------------

The first step is to determine the number of partitions that will be in the
ring. We recommend that there be a minimum of 100 partitions per drive to
insure even distribution across the drives. A good starting point might be
to figure out the maximum number of drives the cluster will contain, and then
multiply by 100, and then round up to the nearest power of two.

For example, imagine we are building a cluster that will have no more than
5,000 drives. That would mean that we would have a total number of 500,000
partitions, which is pretty close to 2^19, rounded up.

It is also a good idea to keep the number of partitions small (relatively).
The more partitions there are, the more work that has to be done by the
replicators and other backend jobs and the more memory the rings consume in
process. The goal is to find a good balance between small rings and maximum
cluster size.

The next step is to determine the number of replicas to store of the data.
Currently it is recommended to use 3 (as this is the only value that has
been tested). The higher the number, the more storage that is used but the
less likely you are to lose data.

It is also important to determine how many zones the cluster should have. It is
recommended to start with a minimum of 5 zones. You can start with fewer, but
our testing has shown that having at least five zones is optimal when failures
occur. We also recommend trying to configure the zones at as high a level as
possible to create as much isolation as possible. Some example things to take
into consideration can include physical location, power availability, and
network connectivity. For example, in a small cluster you might decide to
split the zones up by cabinet, with each cabinet having its own power and
network connectivity. The zone concept is very abstract, so feel free to use
it in whatever way best isolates your data from failure. Zones are referenced
by number, beginning with 1.

You can now start building the ring with::

    swift-ring-builder <builder_file> create <part_power> <replicas> <min_part_hours>

This will start the ring build process creating the <builder_file> with
2^<part_power> partitions. <min_part_hours> is the time in hours before a
specific partition can be moved in succession (24 is a good value for this).

Devices can be added to the ring with::

    swift-ring-builder <builder_file> add z<zone>-<ip>:<port>/<device_name>_<meta> <weight>

This will add a device to the ring where <builder_file> is the name of the
builder file that was created previously, <zone> is the number of the zone
this device is in, <ip> is the ip address of the server the device is in,
<port> is the port number that the server is running on, <device_name> is
the name of the device on the server (for example: sdb1), <meta> is a string
of metadata for the device (optional), and <weight> is a float weight that
determines how many partitions are put on the device relative to the rest of
the devices in the cluster (a good starting point is 100.0 x TB on the drive).
Add each device that will be initially in the cluster.

Once all of the devices are added to the ring, run::

    swift-ring-builder <builder_file> rebalance

This will distribute the partitions across the drives in the ring. It is
important whenever making changes to the ring to make all the changes
required before running rebalance. This will ensure that the ring stays as
balanced as possible, and as few partitions are moved as possible.

The above process should be done to make a ring for each storage service
(Account, Container and Object). The builder files will be needed in future
changes to the ring, so it is very important that these be kept and backed up.
The resulting .tar.gz ring file should be pushed to all of the servers in the
cluster. For more information about building rings, running
swift-ring-builder with no options will display help text with available
commands and options. More information on how the ring works internally
can be found in the :doc:`Ring Overview <overview_ring>`.

----------------------------
General Server Configuration
----------------------------

Swift uses paste.deploy (http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/) to manage server
configurations. Default configuration options are set in the `[DEFAULT]`
section, and any options specified there can be overridden in any of the other
sections BUT ONLY BY USING THE SYNTAX ``set option_name = value``. This is the
unfortunate way paste.deploy works and I'll try to explain it in full.

First, here's an example paste.deploy configuration file::

    [DEFAULT]
    name1 = globalvalue
    name2 = globalvalue
    name3 = globalvalue
    set name4 = globalvalue

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline = myapp

    [app:myapp]
    use = egg:mypkg#myapp
    name2 = localvalue
    set name3 = localvalue
    set name5 = localvalue
    name6 = localvalue

The resulting configuration that myapp receives is::

    global {'__file__': '/etc/mypkg/wsgi.conf', 'here': '/etc/mypkg',
            'name1': 'globalvalue',
            'name2': 'globalvalue',
            'name3': 'localvalue',
            'name4': 'globalvalue',
            'name5': 'localvalue',
            'set name4': 'globalvalue'}
    local {'name6': 'localvalue'}

So, `name1` got the global value which is fine since it's only in the `DEFAULT`
section anyway.

`name2` got the global value from `DEFAULT` even though it appears to be
overridden in the `app:myapp` subsection. This is just the unfortunate way
paste.deploy works (at least at the time of this writing.)

`name3` got the local value from the `app:myapp` subsection because it is using
the special paste.deploy syntax of ``set option_name = value``. So, if you want
a default value for most app/filters but want to overridde it in one
subsection, this is how you do it.

`name4` got the global value from `DEFAULT` since it's only in that section
anyway. But, since we used the ``set`` syntax in the `DEFAULT` section even
though we shouldn't, notice we also got a ``set name4`` variable. Weird, but
probably not harmful.

`name5` got the local value from the `app:myapp` subsection since it's only
there anyway, but notice that it is in the global configuration and not the
local configuration. This is because we used the ``set`` syntax to set the
value. Again, weird, but not harmful since Swift just treats the two sets of
configuration values as one set anyway.

`name6` got the local value from `app:myapp` subsection since it's only there,
and since we didn't use the ``set`` syntax, it's only in the local
configuration and not the global one. Though, as indicated above, there is no
special distinction with Swift.

That's quite an explanation for something that should be so much simpler, but
it might be important to know how paste.deploy interprets configuration files.
The main rule to remember when working with Swift configuration files is:

.. note::

    Use the ``set option_name = value`` syntax in subsections if the option is
    also set in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section. Don't get in the habit of always
    using the ``set`` syntax or you'll probably mess up your non-paste.deploy
    configuration files.

=====================  =============================== =======================

Additionally, you need to list all the accounts/users you want here. The format
is::

    user_<account>_<user> = <key> [group] [group] [...] [storage_url]

There are special groups of::

    .reseller_admin = can do anything to any account for this auth
    .admin = can do anything within the account

If neither of these groups are specified, the user can only access containers
that have been explicitly allowed for them by a .admin or .reseller_admin.

The trailing optional storage_url allows you to specify an alternate url to
hand back to the user upon authentication. If not specified, this defaults to::

    http[s]://<ip>:<port>/v1/<reseller_prefix>_<account>

Where http or https depends on whether cert_file is specified in the [DEFAULT]
section, <ip> and <port> are based on the [DEFAULT] section's bind_ip and
bind_port (falling back to 127.0.0.1 and 8080), <reseller_prefix> is from this
section, and <account> is from the user_<account>_<user> name.

Here are example entries, required for running the tests::

    user_admin_admin = admin .admin .reseller_admin
    user_test_tester = testing .admin
    user_test2_tester2 = testing2 .admin
    user_test_tester3 = testing3

------------------------
Memcached Considerations
------------------------

Several of the Services rely on Memcached for caching certain types of
lookups, such as auth tokens, and container/account existence.  Swift does
not do any caching of actual object data.  Memcached should be able to run
on any servers that have available RAM and CPU.  At Rackspace, we run
Memcached on the proxy servers.  The `memcache_servers` config option
in the `proxy-server.conf` should contain all memcached servers.

-----------
System Time
-----------

Time may be relative but it is relatively important for Swift!  Swift uses
timestamps to determine which is the most recent version of an object.
It is very important for the system time on each server in the cluster to
by synced as closely as possible (more so for the proxy server, but in general
it is a good idea for all the servers).  At Rackspace, we use NTP with a local
NTP server to ensure that the system times are as close as possible.  This
should also be monitored to ensure that the times do not vary too much.

----------------------
General Service Tuning
----------------------

Most services support either a worker or concurrency value in the settings.
This allows the services to make effective use of the cores available. A good
starting point to set the concurrency level for the proxy and storage services
to 2 times the number of cores available. If more than one service is
sharing a server, then some experimentation may be needed to find the best
balance.

At Rackspace, our Proxy servers have dual quad core processors, giving us 8
cores. Our testing has shown 16 workers to be a pretty good balance when
saturating a 10g network and gives good CPU utilization.

Our Storage servers all run together on the same servers. These servers have
dual quad core processors, for 8 cores total. We run the Account, Container,
and Object servers with 8 workers each. Most of the background jobs are run
at a concurrency of 1, with the exception of the replicators which are run at
a concurrency of 2.

The above configuration setting should be taken as suggestions and testing
of configuration settings should be done to ensure best utilization of CPU,
network connectivity, and disk I/O.

-------------------------
Filesystem Considerations
-------------------------

Swift is designed to be mostly filesystem agnostic--the only requirement
being that the filesystem supports extended attributes (xattrs). After
thorough testing with our use cases and hardware configurations, XFS was
the best all-around choice. If you decide to use a filesystem other than
XFS, we highly recommend thorough testing.

If you are using XFS, some settings that can dramatically impact
performance. We recommend the following when creating the XFS
partition::

    mkfs.xfs -i size=1024 -f /dev/sda1

Setting the inode size is important, as XFS stores xattr data in the inode.
If the metadata is too large to fit in the inode, a new extent is created,
which can cause quite a performance problem. Upping the inode size to 1024
bytes provides enough room to write the default metadata, plus a little
headroom. We do not recommend running Swift on RAID, but if you are using
RAID it is also important to make sure that the proper sunit and swidth
settings get set so that XFS can make most efficient use of the RAID array.

We also recommend the following example mount options when using XFS::

    mount -t xfs -o noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,logbufs=8 /dev/sda1 /srv/node/sda

For a standard swift install, all data drives are mounted directly under
/srv/node (as can be seen in the above example of mounting /def/sda1 as
/srv/node/sda). If you choose to mount the drives in another directory,
be sure to set the `devices` config option in all of the server configs to
point to the correct directory.

Swift uses system calls to reserve space for new objects being written into
the system. If your filesystem does not support `fallocate()` or
`posix_fallocate()`, be sure to set the `disable_fallocate = true` config
parameter in account, container, and object server configs.

---------------------
General System Tuning
---------------------

Rackspace currently runs Swift on Ubuntu Server 10.04, and the following
changes have been found to be useful for our use cases.

The following settings should be in `/etc/sysctl.conf`::

    # disable TIME_WAIT.. wait..
    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1
    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1

    # disable syn cookies
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0

    # double amount of allowed conntrack
    net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 262144

To load the updated sysctl settings, run ``sudo sysctl -p``

A note about changing the TIME_WAIT values.  By default the OS will hold
a port open for 60 seconds to ensure that any remaining packets can be
received.  During high usage, and with the number of connections that are
created, it is easy to run out of ports.  We can change this since we are
in control of the network.  If you are not in control of the network, or
do not expect high loads, then you may not want to adjust those values.

----------------------
Logging Considerations
----------------------

Swift is set up to log directly to syslog. Every service can be configured
with the `log_facility` option to set the syslog log facility destination.
We recommended using syslog-ng to route the logs to specific log
files locally on the server and also to remote log collecting servers.
